## 📁 Where Are Credentials Stored?

### **File Location**
```
Instagram DMer/
├── app_settings.json  ← Your credentials are here
├── gui_modern.py
└── ...
```

### **File Format** (`app_settings.json`)
```json
{
    "instagram_username": "your_actual_username",
    "instagram_password": "your_actual_password",
    "default_message": "Hey,\n\nLove the cars...",
    "headless_mode": true,
    "delay_between_messages": 30,
    "messages_per_session": 20,
    "daily_message_limit": 200
}
```

**Important:** This file is in `.gitignore` - won't be committed to Git (secure).

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Settings Manager Class**
- **File**: `settings_manager.py`
- **Method**: JSON file storage
- **Auto-load**: On app startup
- **Auto-save**: On "Save Settings" click

### **Load Priority**
1. **First**: Check `app_settings.json`
2. **Fallback**: Check `.env` file (backward compatible)
3. **Default**: Empty fields (prompt user to enter)

### **What Gets Saved Automatically**
```python
{
    "instagram_username": "from GUI",
    "instagram_password": "from GUI",
    "default_message": "from GUI",
    "headless_mode": "from GUI checkbox",
    "delay_between_messages": "from GUI slider",
    "messages_per_session": "from GUI slider",
    "daily_message_limit": 200
}
```

## 📦 Executable Behavior

### **When Built as .exe**
- Settings saved next to executable: `dist/app_settings.json`
- Portable - copy `dist` folder anywhere
- Settings travel with the executable
- No cloud sync - local file only

### **Distribution**
When sharing the executable:
- **DON'T** include `app_settings.json` (has your credentials!)
- Users create their own settings on first launch
- Each user gets their own `app_settings.json`

## ❓ FAQ

### **Q: Do I need to enter credentials every time?**
A: **NO!** Only the first time. After clicking "Save Settings", they're remembered forever.

### **Q: What if I want to change accounts?**
A: Just go to Settings, change username/password, click "Save Settings". Updated instantly.

### **Q: Is this secure?**
A: Credentials stored in plain text (like .env). Keep the file/folder secure. Use a dedicated Instagram account.

### **Q: What if I delete app_settings.json?**
A: App will start with empty credentials. Just re-enter and save again.

### **Q: Can I edit app_settings.json manually?**
A: Yes! It's JSON format. Or use the GUI (safer, validates inputs).

### **Q: Will my old .env file still work?**
A: Yes! Fully backward compatible. App checks .env if settings file doesn't exist.
